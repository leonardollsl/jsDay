/*
Undefined
In JavaScript, if we don't assign a value to a variable, the value is undefined. In addition to that, if a function is not returning anything, it returns undefined.

let firstName
console.log(firstName) // undefined, because it is not assigned to a value yet
*/

/*
Null
Null in JavaScript means an empty value.

let emptyValue = null*/
